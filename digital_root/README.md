# Digital Root (Sum of Digits)

[Digital root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root) is the recursive sum
of all the digits in a number.


Given n, take the sum of the digits `n`. If that value has more than one digit,
continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The
input will be non-negative integer.
